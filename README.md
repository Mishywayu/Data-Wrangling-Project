# Data Manipulation and Analysis Questions:
1.	Reading the Data:
    * Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. ✅
    * Display the first 10 rows to get an overview of the data. ✅
2.	Handling Missing Values:
	* Identify columns with missing values and the number of missing values in each. ✅
	* Impute missing values in the Age column with the mean value. ✅
	* Fill missing Department values with "Not Specified." ✅
3.	Dealing with Inconsistent Data:
	* Standardize the Department column to ensure all values are in uppercase. ✅
	* Remove any leading or trailing whitespace in the Comments column. ✅
4.	Identifying and Handling Outliers:
	* Identify outliers in the Salary column using a box plot.
	* Replace salaries that are above the 99th percentile with the median salary.
5.	Removing Duplicates:
	* Check for duplicate rows in the dataset. ✅
	* Remove any duplicate rows found. ✅
6.	Date Parsing and Transformation:
	* Convert the Joining Date column to a standard datetime format. ✅
	* Extract the year and month from the Joining Date and create two new columns: Joining Year and Joining Month. ✅
7.	Visualization:
	* Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between Age and Salary. ✅
	* Create a box plot for Performance Score by Department. ✅
	* Plot the distribution of Salary values.
8.	Grouping and Aggregation:
	* Calculate the average Salary for each Department. ✅
	* Count the number of employees in each Joining Year. ✅
9.	Boolean Filtering:
	* Filter the dataset to show only active employees (IsActive is True). ✅
	* Identify employees with a Performance Score of 8 or above and a Salary greater than 100,000. ✅
